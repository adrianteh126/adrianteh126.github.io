# It's Finally Live 🎉

This blog has been sitting in **“work in progress” mode**.
I'm genuinely excited to share this with you all.

## Why I Built This

I didn't want to use Medium.
I didn't want a CMS.
I didn't want to depend on a platform.

I wanted:

- My own system
- Full control
- Markdown writing
- Clean UI
- Static hosting
- Zero backend cost

So I built it from scratch and deployed it to GitHub Pages.

Simple, lightweight — but it does exactly what I need.

---

## What It's Built With 🏗️

Nothing crazy. Just a modern, clean stack:

- **Next.js (App Router)** for the framework
- **React 19**
- **TypeScript**
- **MDX** so I can write Markdown + React together
- **Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations
- **GitHub Actions** to auto-deploy
- Static export for GitHub Pages hosting

Every post is just an `.mdx` file.

## A Few Things I'm Proud Of

- Responsive typography that scales nicely on any device
- Custom MDX styling so all markdown looks clean by default
- Sticky navigation that adapts based on the current route
- Static site export configured specifically for GitHub Pages
- Clean CI/CD pipeline that deploys automatically on push

It's simple — but thoughtfully built.

## What I'll Be Writing About

This space will mostly cover:

- Engineering notes
- Dev experiments
- And occasionally — casual thoughts on tech and life

Basically, things I'm building or learning.

---

## This Is Just The Beginning

The blog system itself is still evolving.

Planned improvements:

- Tag filtering
- Search
- RSS
- Reading time estimation
- Maybe comments (still thinking about that one)

But for now — it works.

And I'm happy it's finally out of “coming soon” mode.
